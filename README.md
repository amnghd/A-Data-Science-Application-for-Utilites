# A-Data-Science-Application-for-Utilites
This repository is no meant to be for code, rather it tries to publicize the application of data science in a very old field, Power Utilities. Our colleagues and I have performed 6 years of research and published its results. Since the code parts are confidential, I will try to give you an understanding of the phenomenon and shed light on another possible direction for data scientists to look for oppurtunities.

The provided jupyter notebooks are the explanation of [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779616304187) and [this](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6915897/) articles.

Please email me if you have any questions on this topic (my email is available in the articles).
